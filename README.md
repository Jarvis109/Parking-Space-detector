## Introduction

Parking space detection is a critical component of smart city infrastructure, bringing a range of benefits:

- **Efficient Parking Management**: It helps drivers quickly find available parking spaces, reducing congestion and fuel consumption.

- **Reduced Emissions**: By minimizing the time spent searching for parking, it can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

- **Improved User Experience**: It enhances the overall parking experience for users by providing real-time information on parking availability.

- **Revenue Generation**: For parking lot operators, it can be a revenue-generation tool by optimizing space allocation and pricing.

This repository provides resources and code samples for implementing parking space detection systems, making it easier for you to explore and develop applications in this innovative field.
